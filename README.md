# 3D Calendar Visualisation
===============================================

A 3D visualisation toolkit for calendar data powered by C++/OpenGL/GLUT.
The aim of this project is to explore other ways to present calendar information which might give a more vivid impression of time and events.

===============================================

Planned schedule:
| WEEK NO. | STARTS | DESCRIPTION |
| :---------- | :----------: | :---------- |
| WEEK 1 | (MON 26 JAN) | BACKGROUND READING, POSSIBLE CALENDAR DESIGNS/STRUCTURES/REQUIREMENTS |
| WEEK 2 | (MON  2 FEB) | BUILD A CALENDAR PROGRAM, C++/OPENGL/GLUT/MVC |
| WEEK 3 | (MON  9 FEB) | RESEARCH INTO VISUALISATION OF DATA (CALENDAR) |
| WEEK 4 | (MON 16 FEB) | EXPLORE, EXPERIMENT, PROTOTYPE POSSIBLE VISUALISATION TECHNIQUES |
| WEEK 5 | (MON 23 FEB) | BUILD WORKING PROTOTYPE, ON TOP OF CALENDAR PROGRAM |
| WEEK 6 | (MON  2 MAR) | CONTINUED -> |
| WEEK 7 | (MON  9 MAR) | DEMO VISUALISATION TOOLKIT, EVALUATE, BUILD ON FEEDBACK |
| WEEK 8 | (MON 16 MAR) | WRITE-UP REPORT, EXPLORED IDEAS/CONCEPTS |
| WEEK 9 | (MON 23 MAR) | CONTINUED -> |
| WEEK 10 | (MON 30 MAR) | CODE DOCUMENTATION/TESTING |
| WEEK 11 | (MON  6 APR) | EVALUATION |
| WEEK 12 | (MON 13 APR) | PROOF READING AND FINALL SUBMISSION |

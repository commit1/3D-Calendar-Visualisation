# 3D Calendar Visualisation

A 3D visualisation toolkit for calendar data powered by C++/OpenGL/GLUT. <p> Calendars and timetables are usually presented in the form of a two-dimensional grid. Although this representation is easy to display, it bears little relation to the actual structure of time and is not well-suited to indicating the relative importance and relationship between different events. The aim of this project is to explore other ways to present calendar information which might give a more vivid impression of time and events.

Used tools:
* tiny file dialogs [by Guillaume Vareille]: Cross-platform dialogs in C C++ WINDOWS OSX GNOME KDE SOLARIS CONSOLE <p>http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyfiledialogs/
  

===============================================

Features to be explored:
- [x] accept input data, possibly ics(iCal) and csv format
- [ ] parse csv data format
- [ ] parse ics data format
- [x] allow options for various visualisation methods
- [ ] display data in calendar 3D form
- [ ] display visualisation prototypes
- [ ]
